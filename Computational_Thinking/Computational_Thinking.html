<h1>Computational Thinking in Animation</h1>
<h2>What is Computational Thinking?</h2>

<p>Computational Thinking is a way of thinking like a 
    computer scientist- not a computer- to solve complex 
    problems. There are four parts to computational thinking:</p>


    <h3>Decomposition</h3>
    <p>Descomposition is breaking a problem down into small parts or problems. 
        By doing this you can examine each smaller problem easier. 




    </p>

    <h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
    <p>
        Pattern Recognition is finding patterns in each of the smaller problems created in Decomposition. 
        You can look for ways similar problems have been solved by doing this. 


    </p>

    <h3>Abstraction</h3>
    <p>
        Abstraction is removing and ignoring the details of a problem and focusing only on the important parts of it.
         This is done in tandem with Pattern Recognition. 

    </p>

    <h3>Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
        Algoritms are sets of instructions to solve or do soemthing. These are developed after the previous three steps are executed. 
        Algorithms are the solutions ot each of the small problems from Decomposition.

<h2>How Can Computational Thinking be Applied to Animation?</h2>
<p>Computational Thinking can be applied across fields and even in every day life. 
    I am majoring in animation, and while learning about computational thinking I considered how it could be applied to animation. 
I will demonstrate one application of Computational Thinking in animation below. </p>


<p>Imagine you are animating someone walking for the first time. 
    There are a lot of things to consider: each limb is moving differently, the head and face have diffferent movements, even the hands and feet have there own movements. 
    It can get overwhelming trying to figure out what to tackle first.

<b>This is where Computational Thinking comes in.
     </b>

<br>
<br>

Instead of thinking of every part at once, engage in <b>Decomposition</b>. Think of the body as all it's different parts: arms, legs, head, hands, feet. 
 <br>
 <br>
 Next, think about <b>Pattern Recognition</b>. 
 Have you animated once of these body parts before?
 Have you drawn them before?
When you did how did they move?
From here you can establish a general idea of how each body parts moves individually. 

<br>
<br>

  While you do this keep <b>Abstraction</b> in mind.
   While each individual body parts movements affects every other body parts movements, we do not need to worry about this yet. 
   It is most important to establish the individual movmeents first. 

<br>
<br>
Finally, we can think about <b>Algorithms</b>. 
Now that you have considered how each body part moves you can create a set of instructions on how it works and how to draw or model it in your animation. 
You can put the algorithms for each body part together, and there you have it: a person walking!
Now, you can go back and observe how each body part affects each other and adjust accordingly. 

<br>
<br>
Animation is complicated and it can be hard to figure out how all the different parts of something move at once. 
Through <b>Computational Thinking</b> we can figure things out on a smaller scale and make the process much more maneageable.
